Welcome to the Music Recommendation System from Facial Expressions! This innovative system utilizes facial expression analysis to suggest personalized music recommendations based on the user's emotions. By analyzing facial cues and emotions, the system aims to enhance the music listening experience by providing songs that align with the user's current mood.

How It Works
Facial Expression Detection: The system uses computer vision techniques to analyze the user's facial expressions in real-time or from an uploaded image. It identifies key facial features and extracts emotional cues such as happiness, sadness, and more.

Emotion Mapping: The detected emotions are then mapped to corresponding musical attributes. For instance, a happy expression might correspond to upbeat and energetic songs, while a sad expression could lead to more entertaining tracks.

Music Recommendation: Based on the mapped emotions, the system recommends a personalized playlist from a curated music database. The playlist includes songs that are likely to resonate with the user's emotional state.
